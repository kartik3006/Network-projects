The goal is to create multiple VLANs on switches and enable communication between these VLANs using Inter-VLAN Routing. Additionally, we want to implement the EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) routing protocol for dynamic routing between the VLANs.

Topology:
Devices:
Router: Connects to switches.
Switch1: VLAN 10 (192.168.10.0/24)
Switch2: VLAN 20 (192.168.20.0/24)
